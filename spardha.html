					   <h2 style="text-decoration : underline"> Indian Cricket History :- </h2> 
                       <p class="para"> The British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721.In 1848, 
					   the Parsi community in Bombay formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians. After slow 
					   beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877. By 1912, the Parsis, Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims 
					   of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans every year. In the early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for
					   the England cricket team. Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and KS Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their
					   names went on to be used for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy â€“ two major first-class tournaments in India. In 1911, an Indian
					   team went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team.

					   <h2 style="text-decoration : underline"> Indian Football  History :- </h2> 
                       <p class="para"> Football was introduced to India by British soldiers in the mid-nineteenth century. It spread because of the 
					   efforts of Nagendra Prasad Sarbadhikari. In 1888 the Durand Cup was founded by then India's Foreign Secretary, Mortimer Durand 
					   at Simla, India. The Durand Cup is the third oldest football competition behind the FA Cup and the Scottish Cup. It was initiated, 
					   as a recreation for British troops stationed in India. Royal Scots Fusiliers won the first edition of the cup by beating Highland 
					   Light Infantry 2â€“1 in the Final. In 1893 the IFA Shield was founded as the fourth oldest trophy in the world. Calcutta, then capital 
					   of British India, soon became the hub of Indian football. Sarada FC was the oldest Indian football club.
                       Calcutta FC was the first club to be established in 1872. Other early clubs include Dalhousie Club, Traders Club and Naval 
					   Volunteers Club. </p>

					   of glass is still available in one of the palaces in Patiala, India. It became very popular among the masses after World War I. 
					   State-level competitions were being held in different States of India during early part of the nineteenth century. Serious carrom 
					   tournaments may have begun in Sri Lanka in 1935 but by 1958, both India and Sri Lanka had formed official federations of carrom clubs, 
					   sponsoring tournaments and awarding prizes.
                       The International Carrom Federation (ICF) was formed in the year 1988 in Chennai, India. The formal rules for the Indian version 
					   of the game were published in 1988. In the same year the ICF officially codified the rules. The game has been very popular throughout 
					   South Asia, mainly in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. It has gained some popularity in Europe and the United States
					   where it has been introduced by the Indian diaspora.</p>

                      <p class="para"> The history of chess goes back almost 1500 years. The game originated in northern India in the 6th century AD and 
					   spread to Persia. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently, through the Moorish 
					   conquest of Spain, spread to Southern Europe.
                       In Europe, the moves of the pieces changed in the 15th century. The modern game starts with these changes. In the second half of the 
					   19th century, modern tournament play began. Chess clocks were first used in 1883, and the first world chess championship was held in 
					   1886. The 20th century saw advances in chess theory, and the establishment of the World Chess Federation (FIDE). Chess engines 
					   (programs that play chess), and chess data bases became important. </p>
